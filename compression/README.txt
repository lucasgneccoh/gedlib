# To make the codes work:
1. Install gedlib by runing the install.py file from the gedlib folder
2. Go to gedlib/compression/build and open a terminal
3. Execute the following commands:
	cmake ..
	make
4. Now you can execute the compression code using the run.sh file. Change the variable values and run it in the same terminal 
	bash run.sh

NOTE: The run.sh file has a structure that depends on the code for now. As I have been doing different tests, you will find variables that are not used.
